I. Installation
Install the resource agents SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology in the standard resource 
agents location of your pacemaker installation (normally 
/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat).
Please follow the instructions in the Setup Guide provided by your
Linux Distribution.

II. Supported Scenarios and Prerequisites
For the first version of the SAPHanaSR resource agent software package we limit
the support to the following scenarios and parameters:

1. Two-node clusters
2. Scale-UP (single-box to single-box) system replication
3. Both nodes are in the same network segment (layer 2)
4. Technical users and groups such as sidadm are defined locally in the Linux 
   system
5. Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address can be done 
   locally on all cluster nodes
6. Time synchronization between the cluster nodes using NTP
7. There is no other SAP HANA system (like QA) on the replicating node which 
   needs to be stopped during takeover.
8. Only one system replication for the SAP HANA database
9. Both SAP HANA instances have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and 
   Instance-Number
10. If the cluster nodes are installed in different data centers or data center 
    areas, the environment must match the requirements of the SLE HAE cluster 
    product. This in special means the network latencies between the nodes and 
    the recommended maximum distance. Please review our product documentation 
    for SLE HAE about those recommendations.
11. As a good starting configuration for PoCs and projects we recommend to 
    switch-off the automated registration of a failed primary. The setup 
    AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false” is also the default since version 0.139.
